----------------- Ideas ---------------------
-echo that redraws a line parallel to a given line.
    given: -number of redraws
           -percent of opacity to inc or dec each redraw
           -amount of noise introduced to each redraw 

-plants that can grow on structures
    -a variety of trees
    -mushrooms
    -add noise adjusting function to make branches bigger or smaller

-foreground builder using paths
    -make option to choose connected nodes with no overlap
    -make multiple path option where each tree can be on individual paths


-different ways to render a path after it's formed
    -as an example: a mushroom path is grown off the side of a structure
        the mushroom could then be drawn by filling it with a series of 
        echos lines as mentioned above

-output to G-code

-add paths and nodes to the triangle mapping feature for further manipulation
    -make a in a linked list where each node in the list is
        represnts an intersecting point of the triangles
        each node tracks: 
        - all connected nodes
        - the distances to each connected node
        - node data and settings
        - all connected path data and settings

-user interface

-forground to background fill tool 

-ray tracing tool
