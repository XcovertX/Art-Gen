# Art-Gen

As a developer and lover of art, I decided to develop a generative art program to explore the depths of procedural art as well as sharpen my dev skills. Art-Gen (when finished) will be a collection of generative tools that will ultimately be controlled by a bot to regularly formulate new works of art, post them to social media, and prioritize sequences that receive positive feedback. 

I chose to write this in Clojure for a few reasons. First, very little boilerplate was required to get started. This was ideal for experimentation and development of generative art tools. Likewise, the Quil library is lightweight and easy to implement and utilize. Second, I wanted to experiment with functional programming and immutable data structures. Designing the program this way should make multithreading and concurrency easier to tackle. 

This project is nowhere close to being done given that I have only worked on it during school breaks, however, I have managed to put together a handful of interesting tools for generative art. Here are some of the results: 

## Triangle Mapping:

The triangle mapping feature first divides the canvas into two triangles. It then recursively divides each triangle to a given depth. To keep the triangles interesting and visually appealing, the function divides each triangle by its longest edge. This creates a more balanced look and avoids long, skinny triangles. The function call specifies the max depth to be achieved and allows for random variables to halt the recursive division prematurely, creating interesting larger triangle "holes" the triangle map. Once the final depth triangle is reached, the function uses a barycentric algorithm to collect all of the pixels within the triangle. The returned result is a map of triangle pixel collections that can be further modified.

In the following example outputs, I experimented with inputting an image, recursively dividing the image into triangles and averaging the RGB values of each triangle to produce a triangular-pixelated effect:

## Rectangle Mapping

This tool works just like triangle mapping, albeit, it's a bit more straightforward and it uses the golden ratio to determine division points. Here are a few examples:

## Hitomezashi Stitch

After watching this Numberphile video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbfhzlMk2eY I thought it would be a cool tool for my Art-Gen bot to have and incorporate in different works:

## Cellular Growth

The cellular growth tool will allow the program to utilize differential growth to fill voids with 'organic' 2-d structures. The stuctures are made up of a number of nodes that formulate paths. The algorithm iterates over all of the nodes and applies a number of forces that repulse/attract nodes to eachother and add/delete node when they are too far appart or near to eachother. This effect creates a very cool looking coral-like structure that can be grown in any void within the painting.

## Future

Currently, I am working on implementing a multi-threading capability to reduce the runtime needed process the cellular, differential growth functions.
